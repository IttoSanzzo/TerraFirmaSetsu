### Introduction

TerraFirmaSetsu is a TerraFirmaCraft-based modpack developed as a personal hobby project, originally created for private use by the SetsuTeaParty community.  
It is now publicly available for anyone interested in experimenting with a survival experience grounded in TerraFirmaCraft, seasoned with technological and magical progression systems.

## 🌍 Project Vision

I aimed to deliver a grounded yet immersive survival experience built on TerraFirmaCraft’s core philosophy, while remaining broad enough to accommodate different playstyles and interests.

The modpack is designed to support multiple progression paths, including:

- **Magical branches**, featuring mods such as Mana and Artifice, Botania, Hexerei, Malum, Blood Magic, and others
- **Technical and industrial progression**, with mods like Immersive Engineering, Create, Thermal Expansion, and similar systems

These paths are intended to coexist rather than compete, allowing players to specialize or combine approaches as they see fit.

## 🧱 Multiplayer & Server Compatibility

TerraFirmaSetsu is fully compatible with multiplayer gameplay and dedicated servers.

The modpack is suitable for long-term worlds and encourages cooperation, specialization, and community-driven progression, supporting both small groups and larger player bases.

## 🚧 Project Status

- **Current stage:** Maintenance-oriented development
- The modpack is fully stable and functional in its current state
- Updates focus on keeping mods up to date and addressing issues as they arise
- Development and maintenance occur on an occasional basis, as the project is maintained by a single developer (me 🙃).
