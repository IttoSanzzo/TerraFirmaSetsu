Second and non-obvious use: say you have a duplicate wood type; normally it just gets recipes that give blocks of other type of same name; but if you really, really wish to have blocks of this type, black-list them here so that they are not added to dupes list and in blocks_with_dumbass_names setting in this file, add them in format modid:planks/slab/strippedlog; good example is Vinery mod which insists on cherry wood even in 1.20; if you do this, you get workshop blocks in vanilla cherry (light pink) and Vinery's cherry (dark red) separately. Oh, and asterisk after the colon works.",
